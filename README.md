# Fuse.Entities

This is the old Fuse.Entities code-base, that was once a part of the
standard distribution of Fuse. It's now been extracted out into this
largely unmaintained support library.

Do not use this unless you're willing to do some patching every now
and then, as this code might break unexpectedly.
